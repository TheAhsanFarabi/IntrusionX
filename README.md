# ðŸš€ IntrusionX: SSA-Optimized Convâ€“LSTM for Network Intrusion Detection  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
**IntrusionX** is a hybrid deep learning framework for **Network Intrusion Detection (IDS)**.  
It combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for temporal learning.  
To optimize hyperparameters, we use the **Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA)** â€” a lightweight swarm intelligence method.  

Our pipeline includes **leak-free preprocessing, stratified data splitting, and dynamic class weighting**, ensuring improved performance on rare attack classes.

## âœ¨ Key Results  
- **Binary classification (Normal vs Attack):** 98% accuracy, AUC = 0.9986  
- **5-class classification (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R, Normal):** 87% accuracy, Weighted F1 = 0.90  
- **Rare-class recall:** R2L = 93%, U2R = 71%
