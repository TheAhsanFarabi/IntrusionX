### Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

Designed an advanced machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to enhance cybersecurity by identifying and mitigating network threats.

- Implemented **ensemble learning techniques (Boosting and Bagging)** for robust anomaly detection.
- Trained the model using the **NSL-KDD 10 dataset**, achieving **99% detection accuracy** in identifying network intrusions.
- Conducted comprehensive **feature engineering** and utilized **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to optimize model performance and increase detection efficiency.
